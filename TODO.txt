TODO:

Improve forkability
  Should the OPERATOR and PARADISE specific config values still exist?
  Document every variable, method, and section of the main function in rainPass.compute
    Maybe rewrite it? Make the time based stuff easier to read?

  Write a document (and include images) that explains the underlying principle of the rain pass

  Is the pipeline stuff just too bizarre?


Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?
  New glyphs?
    Good luck with that, champ




Audio
  Synthesize raindrop sound
  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash
