WebGPU
  std140
    Right now, buildStruct packs an array, which is changed to a typedarray and fed to a GPUBuffer
      That limits the type to whatever the typedarray is
    Instead, we need to represent the type of each value, and write it as such
      Create an array buffer
      Create a Float32Array view into it, and an Int32Array view
      Transcribe the values into these views
      Return the array buffer


Write an explanation of the rain pass (and include images)
  Compute
  Volumetric quads
  Fullscreen quad and spacial mapping
  MSDFs

Support looping

Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?
  New glyphs?
    Good luck with that, champ

Audio
  Synthesize raindrop sound
  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash
