Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?

  Post processing
    Radial hue shift
      Blue in top center
      Yellow in bottom corners
    Blurring towards the edges, like a tilt-shift effect
      Maybe adjust the bloom pass's sampling based on distance to center

  Upward glyphs?

  New glyphs?

Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash

Sounds
  Raindrop sound
  Deja vu sound
  ripple sound
  And some kind of ambient sound that they play over
