TODO:

Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash

Sounds
  Raindrop sound
  Deja vu sound
  ripple sound
  And some kind of ambient sound that they play over
