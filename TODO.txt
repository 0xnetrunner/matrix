TODO:


Improve forkability
  Should the OPERATOR and PARADISE specific config values still exist?
  Rename compute.frag to rain.compute
  Rename bloom tex to blur tex
    And rename bloom pass to blur pass
  Document every variable, method, and section of the main function in compute.frag
    Maybe rewrite it? Make the time based stuff easier to read?

  Write a document (and include images) that explains the underlying principle of the rain pass

  Create interactive controls?
  Is the pipeline stuff just too bizarre?


Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?

  Post processing
    Radial hue shift
      Blue in top center
      Yellow in bottom corners
    Blurring towards the edges, like a tilt-shift effect
      Maybe adjust the bloom pass's sampling based on distance to center

  Upward glyphs?

  New glyphs?






Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash

Sounds
  Raindrop sound
  Deja vu sound
  ripple sound
  And some kind of ambient sound that they play over
