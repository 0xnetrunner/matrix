TODO:

Audio system
  Toggle (or number representing frequency)
  Load the sound effect
  Play it multiple times with delay
    Random pan
    Random volume?
    Randomize pitch a little?

Regenerate the MSDF for "updated" glyph set
  Finalize database order
  Rearrange
  Generate SVGs
  MSDF
  Combine
  Test

Playdate version
  Regenerate texture
  At this point, pay someone to make the sound effect or something
    Audio toggle in system menu
  Launcher card
    Resurrecta title
    Record 3D footage off web version with text in front of it

  Menu later?

Create a Resurrections font
  Icomoon
  Unicode PUA

Reformulate the basis
  https://buf.com/films/the-matrix-resurrections
  Why does my existing affect feel *sparser* than these?
  Softer edgesâ€” base them on fwidth still, just soften them
  Base cursors and other colors on BUF clip
    Pixel grill?
  Tighten the threshold
  Tweak the colors
  Maybe glow can be an SDF-derived effect instead, look into it

  Migrate the rest of the project over
  Migrate WebGPU

Resurrections
  Support random glyph order
  Support anomaly streaks
    Texture
    Lighting
      Different parts of a streak glow at different intensities, at different times
      The streaks often dim slower, ie. are brighter, than the glyphs beneath them
      Imagine they're metallic or something
  Support SDF bevel and "lights"
    https://shaderfun.com/2018/07/23/signed-distance-fields-part-8-gradients-bevels-and-noise/
    Get the "normals" and color right
      Note: even completely dark glyphs can have glint on their edges
      "Golden hour"
  Eventually improve expanded new glyph set
    Make font

WebGPU
  Why is it brighter than the regl version?
  Try https://github.com/brendan-duncan/wgsl_reflect
  Get rid of end pass once it's possible to copy a bgra8unorm to a canvas texture
  Switch to rgba32float somehow?
    Why isn't this straightforward?

Support looping

Write an explanation of the rain pass (and include images)
  Compute
  Volumetric quads
  Fullscreen quad and spacial mapping
  MSDFs

gpu-buffer, working title
  Try and use it for the palette color buffer
  Test it
  Demo it to others
  Make improvements
  Capture expected requirements down the road, make roadmap
  License it and put it somewhere else

Zion Control's matrix variant

Audio
  Synthesize raindrop sound

  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash
