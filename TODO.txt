  First decent rainRender
    Port render pass 100%
      For now, use noise instead of the data texture
      Get all the uniforms in
        Categorize them into buffers
    Port compute pass 100%
      Compute entry point can live in the same wgsl file, I think
      More uniforms! Categorize!
      use textureLoad for texel access in render pipeline
    Render target
      Resize accordingly
    Put in its own module
  Blur: compute or render?
  The other passes should be a breeze
    Just add them to the render bundle

  std140
    Document and share it


Write an explanation of the rain pass (and include images)
  Compute
  Volumetric quads
  Fullscreen quad and spacial mapping
  MSDFs

Support looping

Resurrection
  Modified glyph order?
  New glyphs?
    Good luck with that, champ

Audio
  Synthesize raindrop sound
  Use WebAudio to mess with it

Idea: Build a UI
  Changes some uniforms
  Effect selection would swap out the desired effect pass, somehow
  The color palette stuff would be hard


Experiment with varying the colors in the palette pass
  Maybe a separate palette for the non-bloom
  Maybe dim and widen the bloom
  Just make sure the changes to non-default configurations are acceptable

  Maybe try and accomplish the effect in Photoshop, to get a sense of what's going on

Deja vu effect: flashing rows
  Make them flash all the time
  Then use a thunder-like pattern to show and hide the flash
